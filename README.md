# AroundTheWorldColliderVisualizer
Mod for viewing specific colliders in various places relevant to speedrunning (originally built for the DLC achievement Around the World in 90 Seconds). Use the settings menu to toggle various collider categories.

Based on loco-choco's [Collider Visualizer](https://outerwildsmods.com/mods/collidervisualizer/) mod, but with more customizability and with a focus on speedrunning.

More colliders and options to be added in the future! I'll probably see it if you ask anywhere on the Outer Wilds Speedrunning Discord, or you can ping @MDJ287 on the Speedrunning or Modding servers.
